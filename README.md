# The Odin Project: Etch-a-sketch

In this project I dove deeper into javascript DOM manipulation.

Current features include:

* Customizable grid size slider with an input box
* Random ROYGBIV ink
* An eraser
* Full grid clear button

Future features I want to add:

* Export to jpg
* Undo button
* Hide grid
* Color hash selector with a palette
